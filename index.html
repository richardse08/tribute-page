                            <li>Colonel Harland Sanders, better known as "The Colonel", was born on Tuesday September 9, 1890, in Henryville, Indiana </li>
                            <li>At age 5, his father passed away </li>
                            <li>At age 16, he dropped out of school </li>
                            <li>By age 17, he had already been employed, and terminated, four times </li>
                            <li>When he was merely 20 years old, his wife left him and took the baby leaving Harland alone </li>

                            <li>Despite his multitude of odd-jobs, The Colonel worked mostly as a cook until his eventual retirement at 65 </li>
                            <li>Upon realzing his life was a failure, Colonel Harland Sanders decided he would end it and take his own life... </li>
                            <li>While writing his will, The Colonel thought to himself what he could have accomplished with his life had he done things differently </li>
                            <li>It became clear to the elderly Harland that he only excelled at one thing: Cooking </li>
